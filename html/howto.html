                    <span>You start off with 3 Pac-Men.Your goal is to navigate the maze, eating the dots that are spread all over. 
                    You have 4 different direction to move Pac-Man (up-down-left-right). 
                    When the first stage is cleared (all dots are eaten up) you go on to 2 stage and so on.<br>
                    The maze is represented by the map of the C building. You you will be placed on a particular floor, according 
                    to your level of studies, and the classrooms will represent the actual levels of the game(stages). Your goal is to
                    pass all levels of the floor and then get to below floors until you reach the exit of the building.</span>

                    <span>To make life a little bit more complicated, there are some ghosts chasing you all over the maze. If one of them gets at you, one life is lost. 
                    The game is over when all Pac-Men are eaten up.<br> To be more fun, the ghosts will be represented by some of your teachers
                    or your "friends".</span>

                    <span>For each dot you eat, you get 10 points. In addition to all the usual dots there are 4 special blinking dots 
                    (often referred to as "power pills" or "course bonuses", worth 200 points each) the size being somewhat bigger than the ordinary ones. 
                    When you eat one of them, the ghosts turn blue. As they now are trying to escape, you have the chance to eat them. But you only got a limited time to chase them. 
                    Right before they turn back to normal again, they're blinking.</span>
